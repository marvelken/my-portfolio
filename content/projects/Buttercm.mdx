At ButterCMS, my duties involved creating comprehensive tutorial content demonstrating the integration of React applications with their headless CMS platform. I authored detailed tutorials including building a knowledge base powered by React and ButterCMS featuring content management through page types and seamless API integration, and creating a food-ordering application with search and add-to-cart capabilities showcasing React's frontend functionality with ButterCMS's backend content management.
